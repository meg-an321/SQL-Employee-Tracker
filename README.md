# SQL-Employee-Tracker

## Description
A command-line content management system application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL.

This application is a command line program that helps manage a companies departments, roles, and employees. 
This application is meant to provide an easy way for non-developers and those unfamiliar with programming, 
an easy way to interact with databases.

## What I learned
Bootcamp students, including myself learned how to use postgres and how to write commands in the shell. Through the shell; located in the terimal, we were
able to delete an existing database and tables and then could create new database and tables. When learning more 
about SQL students were taught the importance of the acronym CRUD:
Create new records by adding new data to the database.
Read data by retrieving and viewing data stored in the database.
Update existing records by modifying data already present in the database.
Delete records by removing data that is no longer needed.
